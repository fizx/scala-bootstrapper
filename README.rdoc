This creates a standard environment for your twitter-centric sbt/scala thrift service.

Usage:

    :$ mkdir foo
    :$ cd foo
    :$ scala-bootstrapper foo
    :$ sbt update test

If you want to track scala-bootstrapper generated files in Git:

    :$ scala-bootstrapper --git foo

To update files (with a new version of scala-bootstrapper), just run it again.
